# Faraday-Cage-toy-problem

matlab code is available in the original paper 
MATHEMATICS OF THE FARADAY CAGE, S. JONATHAN CHAPMAN, DAVID P. HEWETT, AND LLOYD N. TREFETHEN,  SIAM REVIEW 2015.

python code is adapted from the matlab code for fun

Trefethen's paper demonstated that (even just in 2D) the electric field is not exponentially small inside the cage but decays only algebrically.
